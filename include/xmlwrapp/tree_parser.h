    The xml::tree_parser class is used to parse an XML document and generate

    After constructing a tree_parser, with either a file to parse or some in
    memory data to parse, you can walk the tree using the xml::node interface.

    @note You probably don't need to use this class directly anymore and
          can just use the corresponding xml::document constructors.
