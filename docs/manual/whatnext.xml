<chapter id="whatnext"><title>Where To Go From Here</title>
    <para>
	Like most programming tasks, the best place to start is to just dive in. The most obvious place to look is the xmlwrapp
	header files. They are clean and well documented. When any document does not agree with the header file, the header file
	will always win.
    </para>

    <para>
	The header files are documented using the <ulink url="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">Doxygen</ulink> syntax. The
	comments are then used to build the API reference manual. This may be easier to read for some, although I still think the
	header files are a better place to look.
