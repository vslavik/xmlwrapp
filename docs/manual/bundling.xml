<appendix id="bundling"><title>Bundling xmlwrapp</title>
    <para>
	Since xmlwrapp is released under a BSD style license, you may bundle
	it with your software, whether or not it is for commercial gain.
    </para>

    <para>
	The <command>configure.pl</command> has an option that makes it
	easier to build an in-place static library. The name of the option
	is <constant>--contrib</constant>. Using this flag automatically
	configures xmlwrapp to build a static library and generate a
	<filename>xmlwrapp-config</filename> script that points you to this
	library.
    </para>

    <para>
	This allows you to distribute xmlwrapp with your software and not
	require that the user have it already installed. Another side effect
	of this configuration method is that the xmlwrapp header files and
	library will not be installed on the end user's computer.
    </para>

    <para>
	Of course, you could always check to see if xmlwrapp is installed on
	the user's computer before you configure the bundled version. This
	is easy to do using the <filename>xmlwrapp-config</filename> script.
    </para>
