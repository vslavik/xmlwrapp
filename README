0. Introduction
---------------

xmlwrapp is a modern style C++ library for working with XML data, built atop
the venerable libxml2 C library.

Additional resources, bug reports, latest sources etc. can be found on the
project page at http://vslavik.github.io/xmlwrapp/

Packages tarballs can be downloaded from the same location or from
https://github.com/vslavik/xmlwrapp/releases

1. Requirements
---------------

In order to build xmlwrapp, you need libxml2 version 2.4.28 or newer. When
building with XSLT support, libxslt 1.1.6 or newer is required. Both libraries
are available from http://xmlsoft.org.


2. Building on Unix
-------------------

On Unix, the usual Autotools-based build system is used. Building xmlwrapp is
usually as simple as running the following three commands:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

See the output of `./configure --help` for additional settings and options.

Cross-compiling, notably for Windows, is also supported using the usual
--host option, e.g. --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32.


3. Building on Windows
----------------------

The library can be built either with Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, using the
project files from located in platform/Win32 directory or in the same way as
under Unix, i.e. with configure and make, if you have Cygwin installed (note
that MinGW can be used as a cross-compiler under Cygwin, producing native
libraries without any Cygwin dependencies). In either case, you will need to
either build libxml and libxslt for Windows yourself or download the already
built versions from http://www.zlatkovic.com/libxml.en.html or elsewhere.


4. Using xmlwrapp
-----------------

On Unix, you should use pkg-config to get compiler flags for xmlwrapp or
xsltwrapp libraries:

   c++ -c `pkg-config --cflags xmlwrapp` ...
   c++ -o ... `pkg-config --libs xmlwrapp`

On Windows, you need to link against xmlwrapp libraries and add the include/
directory to compiler's headers search path.
